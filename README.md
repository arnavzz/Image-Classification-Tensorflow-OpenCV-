## Project Overview
This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow. It covers the following tasks:
- Data preprocessing
- Model architecture design
- Training and evaluation
- Model testing and saving

## Prerequisites
Before running this notebook, ensure that you have the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- A machine with a GPU (recommended for training)
- Installed dependencies such as TensorFlow and OpenCV

## Installation
To set up your environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
2. **Install Dependencies**:Run the following command to install all necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   !pip install tensorflow tensorflow-gpu opencv-python matplotlib
3. **Set Up GPU (Optional but Recommended)**:If using a GPU, configure TensorFlow to avoid out-of-memory errors:
   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
    gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    for gpu in gpus:
    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
## Notebook Structure
The notebook is organized into the following sections:
  1. **Install Dependencies and Setup**:Install necessary libraries and set up the environment.
  2. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the image data, including removing corrupt or incompatible files.
  3. **Model Building**: Define and compile a deep learning model for image classification.
  4. **Training**: Train the model using the processed data, with TensorBoard for monitoring.
  5. **Evaluation and Testing**: Evaluate the model's performance on test data and visualize the results.
  6. **Model Saving**: Save the trained model for future use.

## Usage
To run the notebook, execute each cell sequentially in a Jupyter environment. Make sure to configure any paths and variables specific to your setup, such as the dataset directory and model save location.

Key commands include:
. Running the notebook:
  ```ba sh
